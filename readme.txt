== Description ==

Pipefy is a business process management platform that makes work easier and faster for frontline employees in HR, Finance, Marketing and Customer Service, including IT and Help Desk. After setting up the process inside Pipefy the users can turn their form public to receive external requests from everyone with the public link.

By using the Pipefy Public Form you don't need to configure emails or SMTPs, all the filled forms will create cards inside your process inside the platform. Inside Pipefy you have an awesome form builder to collect all kind of informations from your visitors like: Short text, long text, attachment, checkbox, assignees, date and datetime, due date, labels, email, phone, drop-down select and radio buttons, time, numeric, currency and documents.

With the Form Launcher plugin you can embed this form in a friendly way inside your website and engage visitors with your public form. Just install the WordPress plugin, insert your public form ID and... that's it.

The plugin will put a Button inside every page you have on the right bottom corner. You can customize the "call to action", the color and choose between a popup or a full-page form experience.
